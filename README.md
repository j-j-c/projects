# Project descriptions


## AVLTree:
Implements the AVL tree data structure (a self-balancing binary search tree) to store, manipulate, and retrieve nodes. The nodes contain a unique 8-digit integer key, and are associated with a non-unique key. Insertions, searches, and deletions are performed with worst-case time complexity of O(log n). Also has functions for a variety of tree traversals.


## Hindsight:

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/8L2AWSpI2CA

Hindsight is designed to compare the performance of two different data structures using a large dataset (daily stock prices). Users can input any combination of stocks and the program will compute the theoretical optimal day trading strategy and calculate the returns. The stock data used is real-world stock data from most stocks of the SP500 from the past two years. As an exercise, two data structures are implemented and their performance on calculating the optimal trading strategy is compared in the output. These data structures are an AA(Arne Andersson) tree and a doubly-linked list with hashed nodes. 


## PageRank:
The project is based on the page rank algorithm used in the early days of google to rank websites and prioritize their placement in search results. Users can input hypothetical website links and number of power iterations to be performed. Using a graph implemented in the form of an adjacency list, the program will perform the algorithm for the given number of power iterations to compute the page ranking for each of the websites.
